# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engenering is the system, disciplined quatified approach to the development, operations and maintainance of software. 
importance of the software engineering is that it ensures software software is reliable, efficient,and meet user needs

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.1955- the first programming languanges like FORTRAN and COBOL emergerd
                      1972-introduction of modular design and software development methodologies
                      1990-Agile methologies and DevOps practices revolutionized software development by improving collaboration, speed and efficiency
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    analysis-- understanding what the software requires
    planning development-creating a roadmap for development
    Design- structuring and designing user experiece
    coding-writing the actual code
    testing-looking for bugs and errors in the code
    deployment- releasing the software to users
    maintainance- improving the software post release

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.waterfall metholodology is always done at the end whereas agile methodology  continuous testing       
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
       software developer writes and maintains code, impliments features. Quality assurance engineer test software to identify bugs and ensure quality
       whereas project mananger oversees project timelines, team coodination, and deliverables
      
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. IDEs- enables and debugging tools and enhance productivity with code suggestions example is pycharm
               . VCS- tracks code changes and enable collaboration among developers  examples is Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.mmeting deadlines , this is avoided through proper planning
                         . debugging complex  code, using debugging tools , write clean code

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 unit testing- tests individual components for correctness
 system testing validates the entire system's functionality 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
     prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective inputs prompts to guide AI models in generating accurate and relevant responces. its importance is that it improves AI accuracy

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"vague prompt" what is the space
"improved prompt" what is the planets such as moon sin and stars
importance is that it  specifies the topic clearly
